# Since bazel_to_cmake doesn't have a global view of targets, it cannot apply
# aspects to collect the proto_library() sources in order to build e.g. upbdefs.
# As a workaround the upb targets are injected into the reposoitory here so that
# other upb libraries can link to the common protos.
#
#  These also become the "well-known-protos" depdendencies for upb/upbdefs.

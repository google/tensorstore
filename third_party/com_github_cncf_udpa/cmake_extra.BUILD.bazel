# Additional targets for bazel_to_cmake to generate:
#
# bazel_to_cmake doesn't have a global view of targets, it cannot lazy load
# dependencies or apply aspects to, for example, collect the proto_library()
# targets that are referenced by other reposotories.
#
# Therefore some targets (particularly protos) must exist in each reposoitory
# where they might be referenced.
#
# Also, bazel_to_cmake target rule generation *does not enforce* that rule
# names must be in the same package, so we can add them all here without
# patching the repository.

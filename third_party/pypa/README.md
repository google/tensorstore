Third-party Python package dependencies
=======================================

The package requirements are specified by the `*_requirements.txt` files.  These
are the *source* files.

The `*_requirements_frozen.txt` and `workspace.bzl` are generated by
`tools/pypi_solver`.

After modifying the `*_requirements.txt` files or updating the list of supported
Python versions in `tools/pypi_solver/utils.py`, re-run `generate_workspace.sh`
to update the derived files.

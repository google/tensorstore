/// NumPy bfloat16 dtype definition

// NumPy does not natively support bfloat16, but allows new data types to be
// defined, This implementation is based on Tensorflow, and uses the same
// approach to conditionally define a bfloat16 NumPy data type: if there is not
// existing data type registered with the name "bfloat16", we define one and
// register it.  Otherwise, we just use the already-registered data type.
//
// Thus, whichever of TensorStore, Tensorflow, JAX (or any other library that
// may define a bfloat16 data type) is imported first is the one to actually
// define the data type, and the subsequently imported libraries interoperate
// with it.  This does mean that there can be slight differences in behavior
// depending on the import order: for example, Tensorflow's bfloat16
// implementation flushes subnormal values to zero when converting from
// `float32`.  But hopefully those differences won't be important.

#include "python/tensorstore/numpy.h"
// We actually just required `Python.h`, but all inclusions of that header are
// done via `numpy.h` to ensure the header order constraints are satisfied.

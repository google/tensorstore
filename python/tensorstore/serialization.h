/// Integration between Python pickling and TensorStore serialization.
///
/// Python pickling works by recursively "reducing" (via `__reduce__` or
/// `__getstate__`) pickle-compatible objects to other pickle-compatible objects
/// until primitive types (like `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `bytes`) and
/// tuples/dicts/lists thereof are reached.  If this reduction results in
/// multiple references to the same object (as determined by pointer equality),
/// the object is encoded only once in the pickled representation and the shared
/// references are reconstructed when unpickling.
///
/// TensorStore serialization supports a similar "indirect reference" mechanism
/// whereby objects with multiple shared references are encoded only once and
/// the shared references are correct reconstructed when decoding.
///
/// There are two forms of integration between Python pickling and TensorStore
/// serialization that are potentially useful:
///
/// 1. Pickling/unpickling of type provided by this library the Python API,
///    where the type supports serialization and additionally may transitively
///    hold a reference to a pickle-compatible Python object.
///
/// 2. Serialization of a type provided by this library from the C++ API, where
///    the type may transitively hold a reference to a pickle-compatible Python
///    object.
///
/// Currently only (1) is implemented, and the implementation is as follows:
///
/// - Bytes written directly to the `EncodeSink::writer` are simply accumulated
///   in an `absl::Cord` and then converted to a `PyBytes` object when done.
///
/// - For indirect object references that written using
///   `EncodeSink::DoIndirect`, we defer the actual encoding of the object, and
///   instead store a wrapper Python object of type `tensorstore._Encodable`
///   that holds a reference to the C++ smart pointer and the
///   `ErasedEncodeWrapperFunction`.  The actual encoding of the object does not
///   occur until the pickle implementation calls the `__reduce__` function of
///   the `tensorstore._Encodable` object.  In order to handle references to
///   actual Python objects, if the smart pointer type is `GilSafePythonHandle`,
///   indicating an actual Python object, then we just store the object directly
///   without creating any wrapper object.
///
/// - The actual pickled representation is a `PyList` where the first element is
///   the `PyBytes` object containing all directly-written data and the
///   remaining elements are the wrapper objects corresponding to indirect
///   references.
///
/// - We must ensure that if a given C++ smart pointer is specified as an
///   indirect reference multiple times, the identical Python wrapper object is
///   returned.  Since Python does not provide a way to store any state specific
///   to an individual pickling operation, we instead rely on a global hash
///   table that maps the C++ pointer address to the corresponding Python
///   wrapper object, similar to the hash table that pybind11 maintains
///   internally.  Once the Python object is destroyed (typically at the end of
///   the pickling operation), the entry is removed from the hash table,
///   preventing the hash table from growing without bound.  There is a
///   possibility that multiple concurrent pickling operations, in which case
///   the same wrapper object may be used by multiple pickling operations, but
///   that is not a problem provided that the `ErasedEncodeWrapperFunction`
///   values specified for a given smart pointer are all interchangeable.
///
/// - The pickled `tensorstore._Encodable` objects get unpickled as
///   `tensorstore._Decodable` objects.  These objects simply hold the pickled
///   representation, and also an initially null `std::shared_ptr<void>` and
///   pointer to `std::type_info` corresponding to the decoded object.  The
///   first time the wrapper object is referenced during decoding, we create the
///   C++ object using the specified `ErasedDecodeWrapperFunction`.  For
///   subsequent references, we just verify that the `type_info` matches and
///   return another reference to the already-decoded object.  The
///   `tensorstore._Decodable` objects will typically be destroyed at the end of
///   the unpicling operation.

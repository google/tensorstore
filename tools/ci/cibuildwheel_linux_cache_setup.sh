# This script fixes directory permissions on host cache directories
# used by the builds run by cibuildwheel within a manylinux container.
#
# To allow cache persistence, host cache directories are shared with
# the container, but since the build runs as root within the
# container, the permissions are not what `pip` or `bazel` expect.

# cibuildwheel runs docker containers as root, and when running as uid
# 0, pip refuses to use a cache directory that is not owned by uid 0.

if [ ! -z "${PIP_CACHE_DIR}" ]; then
  mkdir -p "${PIP_CACHE_DIR}"
  chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" "${PIP_CACHE_DIR}"

# Bazel also expects the cache directory to be owned by the current
# user.

"""CMake implementation of "@tensorstore//third_party:repo.bzl".

The following parameters of `third_party_http_archive` are supported:

- name: str

  Specifies the Bazel repo name.  Used by both Bazel and CMake.

- repo_mapping: Optional[Dict[str, str]]

  Optional.  Maps repository names used by the third-party package to the name
  the repository is available in the top-level workspace.  Used by Bazel, and by
  CMake if `bazel_to_cmake` is specified.

- urls: List[str]

  Required.  Specifies the list of URLs.  Used by both Bazel and CMake.

- sha256: str

  Optional (but should always be specified).  Specifies the sha256 hash in hex
  representation of the archive specified by `urls`.  Used by both Bazel and
  CMake.

- strip_prefix: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Top-level directory to strip when extracting the archive.  Used
  only by Bazel.  CMake seems to auto-detect.

- patches: List[Label]

  Optional.  List of patches to apply.  Used by both Bazel and CMake.

- patch_args: Optional[List[str]]

  Optional.  List of arguments to pass to `patch`, e.g. `["-p1"]` for patches
  produced by `git format-patch`.  Used by both Bazel and CMake.

- patch_cmds: Optional[List[str]]

  Optional.  Specifies list of additional patch commands to perform after
  applying the patches specified by `patches`.  Used by both Bazel and CMake.

- remove_paths: Optional[List[str]]

  Optional.  Specifies a list of files or directories to delete as an additional
  patch action.  Used by both Bazel and CMake.

- build_file: Optional[Label]

  Optional.  Specifies Bazel build file to use (when not using a system version
  of the library).  Overrides any Bazel build file already present.  Used by
  Bazel, and by CMake when `bazel_to_cmake` is specified.

- system_build_file: Optional[Label]

  Optional.  Specifies Bazel build file to use when using a system version of
  the library.  Used only by Bazel.  On CMake, a `FindXXX.cmake` module must be
  provided instead.

- doc_name: Optional[str]

  Optional. Specifies the package name for display in the documentation.  Not
  used when building.

- doc_version: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Specifies the version number for display in the documentation.  Not
  used when building.

- doc_homepage: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Specifies the homepage URL for display in the documentation.  Not
  used when building.

- cmake_name: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Specifies the CMake project name.  Should match the identifier
  typically usde with `find_package`.  Used only by CMake.  If not specified,
  the repository will be ignored in the CMake build.

- bazel_to_cmake: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  If specified, `bazel_to_cmake` is used on the
  dependency in place of a "native" CMake build.  Supported members are:

  - include: Optional[List[str]]

    List of glob patterns matching package names to include in the build,
    e.g. `["", "tensorstore/**"]` to include the top-level package as well as
    all packages under "tensorstore".

  - exclude: Optional[List[str]]

    List of glob patterns matching package names to exclude from the build.

  - aliased_targets_only: bool

    Optional.  If set to `True`, only analyze (and generated CMake targets for)
    the transitive dependencies of targets listed in `cmake_target_mapping`.  If
    `False` (the default), all targets (except `filegroup`) are analyzed.

- cmake_target_mapping: Optional[Dict[RelativeLabel, CMakeTarget]]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  Maps Bazel targets to corresponding CMake
  target names.  Bazel targets may be relative, in which case they are resolved
  relative to the repository `name`.  The CMake target name should be the name
  assigned by existing `FindXXX.cmake` modules, if they exist.  Typically, if
  there is just a single library target, it is named `NAME::NAME`,
  e.g. `JPEG::JPEG`, where `NAME` is the `cmake_name`.  If `bazel_to_cmake` is
  specified, these mappings will be generated.  Otherwise, the specified CMake
  targets must be defined by the existing CMake build (or by
  `cmakelists_suffix` or `cmake_aliases`).

- cmakelists_prefix: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  Additional content to prepend to the CMake
  build configuration for this repository (applies even if `bazel_to_cmake` is
  specified).

- cmakelists_suffix: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  Additional content to append to the CMake
  build configuration for this repository (applies even if `bazel_to_cmake` is
  specified).  This may be used to add additional target properties or define
  additional aliases.

- cmake_settings: Optional[Dict[str, str]]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  CMake variables to set when configuring this
  repository.  These are not added to the CMake cache.  Note that due to the way
  `FetchContent` works, they may also apply to some dependencies of this
  repository.

- cmake_languages: Optional[List[str]]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  List of languages for which `enable_language`
  must be called.  These must be specified since CMake requires all
  `enable_language` calls to happen at the top-level.

- cmake_source_subdir: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  Relative path to the directory containing the
  top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file.

- cmake_package_redirect_extra: Optional[str]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  Additional content to execute when
  `find_package(<NAME>)` is called, where `<NAME>` is equal to `cmake_name`.

  CMake defines `<NAME>_FOUND`, but in order for other CMake projects to
  correctly used this repository as a dependency, other CMake variables may be
  necessary.

  If additional target aliases are needed, they should be defined using
  `cmake_aliases` or `cmakelists_suffix` instead.

  In most cases, the `cmake_package_redirect_libraries` option provides a more
  convenient way to add content to execute.

- cmake_package_redirect_libraries: Optional[Dict[str, CMakeTarget]]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  Maps cmake variable names prefixes to
  corresponding CMake targets.

  For each entry `(var, target)`, the following additional variables are defined
  when `find_package(<NAME>)` is called:

      set(var_LIBRARY target)
      set(var_LIBRARIES target)
      set(VAR_LIBRARY target)
      set(VAR_LIBRARIES target)
      set(var_INCLUDE_DIR <INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of target>)
      set(var_INCLUDE_DIRS <INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of target>)
      set(VAR_INCLUDE_DIR <INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of target>)
      set(VAR_INCLUDE_DIRS <INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of target>)

  Modern CMake builds should just use the target, but some projects rely on
  these variables.

- cmake_package_aliases: Optional[List[str]]

  Optional.  Used only by CMake.  List of additional names for which
  `find_package(<NAME>)` will find this package and execute the content
  specified by `cmake_package_redirect_extra` and
  `cmake_package_redirect_libraries`.

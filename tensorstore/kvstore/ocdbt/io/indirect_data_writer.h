/// `IndirectDataWriter` provides log-structured storage of values on top of an
/// existing kvstore.
///
/// Values may be asynchronously written using the `Write` function.  The
/// relative path, offset, and length where the data will be stored (encoded as
/// an `IndirectDataReference`) is returned immediately.  The actual write may
/// not start until `Future::Force` is called on the returned future, and isn't
/// guaranteed to be durable until the returned future becomes ready.
///
/// Currently, values that are written are buffered in memory until they are
/// explicitly flushed by forcing a returned future.  In the future, there may
/// be support for streaming writes and appending to existing keys in the
/// underlying kvstore.
///
/// This is used to store data values and btree nodes.

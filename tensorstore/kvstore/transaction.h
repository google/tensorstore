/// Facilities for implementing the transactional operations:
///
/// - `kvstore::Driver::ReadModifyWrite`
///
/// - `kvstore::Driver::TransactionalDeleteRange`
///
/// There are three types of key-value store drivers:
///
/// - Terminal: The `kvstore::Driver` directly accesses the underlying storage
///   without going through any lower-level `kvstore::Driver`.  There are two
///   sub-types of terminal `kvstore::Driver`:
///
///   - Non-atomic: implements `Read`, `Write` (and possibly) `DeleteRange` but
///     not any transactional operations.  The default `Driver::ReadModifyWrite`
///     and `Driver::TransactionalDeleteRange` implementations using
///     `NonAtomicTransactionNode` are used, which are based on the driver's
///     non-transactional `Read`, `Write`, and `DeleteRange` methods.  When used
///     with an atomic-mode transaction, the transaction will fail if more than
///     a single key is affected.  The "file" and "gcs" drivers are in this
///     category.
///
///   - Atomic: The `Driver` implements its own `TransactionNode` class
///     that inherits from `AtomicTransactionNode` and defines `ReadModifyWrite`
///     based on `AddReadModifyWrite` and `TransactionalDeleteRange` based on
///     `AddDeleteRange`.  The driver implements non-transactional `Read` and
///     may either directly implement the non-transactional `Write`, or may use
///     `WriteViaTransaction` to implement it in terms of the transactional
///     `ReadModifyWrite`.  The "memory" driver is in this category.
///
/// - Non-terminal: The `Driver` driver is merely an adapter over an underlying
///   `Driver`; the connection to the underlying `Driver` is provided by
///   `KvsBackedCache`.  The uint64_sharded_key_value_store driver is in this
///   category.
///
/// For all three types of key-value store driver, the `MultiPhaseMutation`
/// class tracks the uncommitted transactional operations in order to provide a
/// virtual view of the result after the transaction is committed:
///
/// In the simple case, the only transactional operations are `ReadModifyWrite`
/// operations to independent keys, all in a single phase (i.e. without any
/// interleaved `Transaction::Barrier` calls), and there is not much to track.
///
/// In general, though, there may be multiple `ReadModifyWrite` operations for
/// the same key, possibly with intervening `Transaction::Barrier` calls, and
/// there may be `TransctionalDeleteRange` operations before or after
/// `ReadModifyWrite` operations that affect some of the same keys.  (Note that
/// `Transaction::Barrier` calls are only relevant to terminal key-value store
/// drivers, which use a multi-phase TransactionNode.  A TransactionNode for a
/// non-terminal driver only needs to track operations for a single phase; if
/// transactional operations are performed on a non-terminal key-value store
/// over multiple phases, a separate TransactionNode object is used for each
/// phase.)
///
/// Transactional operations are tracked as follows:
///
/// `MultiPhaseMutation` contains a circular linked list of
/// `SinglePhaseMutation` objects corresponding to each phase in which
/// transactional operations are performed, in order of phase number.
///
/// `SinglePhaseMutation` contains an interval tree (implemented as a red-black
/// tree) containing `ReadModifyWriteEntry` (corresponding to a single key) or
/// `DeleteRangeEntry` (corresponding to a range of keys) objects.  Before
/// commit starts, the entries in the interval tree of the last
/// `SinglePhaseMutation` represent the combined effect of all transactional
/// operations.  This makes it possible for subsequent `ReadModifyWrite`
/// operations to efficiently take into account the current modified state.

      examples:

      title: |
        Additional path within the `KvStore` specified by
        `.kvstore`.
      description: |-
        This is joined as an additional ``"/"``-separated path component
        after any `~KvStore.path` member directly within
        `.kvstore`.  This is supported for backwards compatibility only; the
        `KvStore.path` member should be used instead.
    open:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        Open an existing TensorStore.  If neither `.open` nor
        `.create` is specified, defaults to ``true``.
    create:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        Create a new TensorStore.  Specify ``true`` for both `.open`
        and `.create` to permit either opening an existing TensorStore
        or creating a new TensorStore if it does not already exist.
      default: false
    delete_existing:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        Delete any existing data at the specified path before creating
        a new TensorStore.  Requires that `.create` is
        ``true``, and that `.open` is ``false``.
      default: false
    assume_metadata:
      type: boolean
      description: |-
        Skip reading the metadata if possible.  Instead, just assume any
        necessary metadata based on constraints in the spec, using the same
        defaults for any unspecified metadata as when creating a new
        TensorStore.  Requires that `.open` is ``true`` and that
        `.delete_existing` is ``false``.
        
        .. warning::
        
           This option can lead to data corruption if the assumed metadata does
           not match the stored metadata, or multiple concurrent writers use
           different assumed metadata.
      default: false
    cache_pool:
      $ref: ContextResource
      description: |-
        Specifies or references a previously defined
        `Context.cache_pool`.  It is normally more convenient to
        specify a default `~Context.cache_pool` in the
        `.context`.
      default: cache_pool
    data_copy_concurrency:
      $ref: ContextResource
      description: |-
        Specifies or references a previously defined
        `Context.data_copy_concurrency`.  It is normally more convenient to
        specify a default `~Context.data_copy_concurrency` in the `.context`.
      default: data_copy_concurrency
    recheck_cached_metadata:
      $ref: CacheRevalidationBound
      default: open
      description: |
        Time after which cached metadata is assumed to be fresh.  Cached
        metadata older than the specified time is revalidated prior to use.  The
        metadata is used to check the bounds of every read or write operation.

        Specifying ``true`` means that the metadata will be revalidated
        prior to every read or write operation.  With the default value of
        ``"open"``, any cached metadata is revalidated when the TensorStore
        is opened but is not rechecked for each read or write operation.
    recheck_cached_data:
      $ref: CacheRevalidationBound
      default: true
      description: |
        Time after which cached data is assumed to be fresh.  Cached data older
        than the specified time is revalidated prior to being returned from a
        read operation.  Partial chunk writes are always consistent regardless
        of the value of this option.

        The default value of ``true`` means that cached data is revalidated
        on every read.  To enable in-memory data caching, you must both specify
        a `~Context.cache_pool` with a non-zero
        `~Context.cache_pool.total_bytes_limit` and also specify ``false``,
        ``"open"``, or an explicit time bound for `.recheck_cached_data`.

/// Propagates a downsampling operation through an index transform.
///
/// Given a `downsampled_transform` from index space `downsampled_a` ->
/// `downsampled_b`, computes `propagated.transform` from index space `a` to
/// `b`, and `propagated.input_downsample_factors`, such that:
///
///   downsampling `b` by `output_downsample_factors` (with bounds of
///   `output_base_bounds`) and then transforming by `downsampled_transform`
///
/// is equivalent to:
///
///   transforming `b` by `propgated.transform` and then downsampling by
///   `propgated.input_downsample_factors` (and possibly "squeezing" some
///   singleton dimensions that were added).
///
/// Note that this function assumes downsampling is performed using a method
/// such as `DownsampleMethod::kMean` where an output value can be computed as
/// long as there is at least one in-bounds value.  This function is *not* for
/// use with `DownsampleMethod::kStride`.
///
/// This function supports all index transforms, but some case can be handled
/// more efficiently than others:
///
/// 1. For output dimensions `output_dim` for which
///    `output_downsample_factors[output_dim] == 1`, the resultant
///    `propagated.transform` just uses the same output index map unchanged.
///
/// 2. If output dimension `output_dim` has a `single_input_dimension` map with
///    stide of +/-1 from a unique `input_dim`, then
///    `propagated.input_downsample_factors[input_dim]` is set to
///    `output_downsample_factors[output_dim]` and `transform` uses the same
///    output index map, except that the output offset and input bounds for
///    `input_dim` are adjusted.
///
/// 3. If output dimension `output_dim` has a `constant `map, then it is
///    converted to a `single_input_dimension` map from an additional synthetic
///    input dimension added to `propagated.transform`.
///
/// 4. Otherwise, the output map for `output_dim` is converted to an index array
///    map that depends on an additional synthetic input dimension added to
///    `propagated.transform` with domain `[0, downsample_factor)`, where
///    `downsample_factor = output_downsample_factors[output_dim]`.  Note that
///    this case applies if the output index map in `downsampled_transform` is
///    an index array map or a `single_input_dimension` map with non-unit stride
///    or non-unique input dimension.  It is possible that some of the
///    `downsample_factor` indices within a given downsampling block are outside
///    `output_base_bounds` (this function returns an error if none are in
///    bounds, though).  In that case, since the index transform representation
///    does not support ragged arrays, any out of bound indices are clamped to
///    fit in `output_base_bounds`.  If the downsample factor is greater than 2,
///    this *does* affect the result of the average computation within these
///    boundary blocks.
///
/// If any synthetic input dimensions are added to `transform`, they are
/// guaranteed to become singleton dimensions after downsampling by
/// `propagated.input_downsample_factors`, and they must then be "squeezed"
/// (eliminated) to maintain the equivalence with downsampling before

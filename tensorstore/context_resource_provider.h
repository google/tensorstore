/// \file Interfaces for defining context resource providers.
///
/// To define a new context resource provider, you must define both a `Provider`
/// class (that satisfies the `ContextResourceProviderConcept` concept) and a
/// corresponding `Traits` class (that satisfies the
/// `ContextResourceTraitsConcept<Provider>` concept).  The `Provider` specifies
/// the public interface of the resource, while the `Traits` class specifies the
/// implementation.
///
/// For resource providers that are defined in a header file and are not local
/// to a particular source file, it is recommended to define the `Provider` type
/// in the header file, and to define the separate corresponding `Traits` type
/// in the source file that registers the provider.  For resource providers that
/// are local to a particular source file, it is simpler for the `Provider` type
/// to also serve as the `Traits` type.

/// `std::shared_ptr<const ReadData>`, along with a corresponding
/// `TimestampedStorageGeneration` indicating the generation and time as of
/// which it is known to be current.
///
/// If writes are supported, each `Entry` additionally may have associated
/// `TransactionNode` objects representing uncommitted modifications.  For
/// example, for an entry representing a chunk/region of an array, the
/// modifications may be represented by an `AsyncWriteArray` object specifying
/// new values for the chunk along with a mask indicating which elements have
/// been modified.
///
/// Transaction nodes are used to represent both *transactional* modifications
/// made using an explicit transaction, as well as *non-transactional*
/// modifications, which are automatically assigned to an implicit transaction.
///
///  - The memory required by a explicit transaction node is accounted for in
///    the `total_bytes` of the transaction, but is not accounted for by the
///    `CachePool`, and can neither cause, nor be affected by, automatic
///    writeback triggered by the `queued_for_writeback_bytes_limit` of the
///    `CachePool`.
///
///  - The memory required by an implicit transaction node is accounted for by

/// and `TransactionNode::DoWriteback` as needed to satisfy the requests.

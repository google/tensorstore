/// To define a derived concurrency resource type:
///
/// 1. Define a class that inherits from `ConcurrencyResource` with an `id`
///    member.
///
/// 2. Define a `Traits` type that inherits from `ConcurrencyResourceTraits`
///    (defined in `concurrency_resource_provider.h`) and from
///    `ContextResourceTraits<Traits>` with a default constructor that specifies
///    the shared thread pool size to the `ConcurrencyResourceTraits`
///    constructor.
///
/// 3. Register the `Traits` type using a `ContextResourceRegistration` object.

/// A barrier which blocks threads until a prespecified number of threads
/// utilizes the barrier, then resets allowing the barrier to be used for
/// sequence points (similar to std::barrier). A thread utilizes the
/// `MultiBarrier` by calling `Block()` on the barrier, which will block that
/// thread; no call to `Block()` will return until `num_threads` threads have
/// called it.
///
/// After `num_threads` have called Block(), exactly one call will return
/// `true`, and the barrier will set to an initial state.
///
/// Example:
///
///   // Main thread creates a `Barrier`:
///   MultiBarrier barrier(kNumThreads);
///
///   // Each participating thread could then call:
///   std::atomic<int> winner[kNumThreads] = {};
///   auto thread_func = [&, index]() {
///     while (!done) {
///       if (barrier.Block()) {
///         winner[index]++;
///       }

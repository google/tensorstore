/// Transactions are represented internally by a `TransactionState` object
/// managed by intrusive reference counting.
///
/// The actual modifications contained in the transaction are represented by
/// `TransactionState::Node` objects, which are also managed by intrusive
/// reference counting.  In the common case, a transaction may contain nodes
/// representing modifications to one or more chunks in a `ChunkCache`, as well
/// as nodes representing the downstream writeback of those chunks to an
/// underlying `kvstore::Driver`.  If this `kvstore::Driver` is itself backed by
/// a cache (e.g. in the case of the neuroglancer_precomputed
/// `Uint64ShardedKeyValueStore`), there may be additional downstream nodes.
/// Implicitly, the dependencies between nodes form a forest, where the roots
/// correspond to "terminal" nodes that are added via
/// `GetOrCreateMultiPhaseNode` and on which `MarkAsTerminal` has been called.
///
/// In an isolated, non-atomic transaction, there may be multiple terminal
/// nodes, each of which may also commit non-atomically.  For example, an
/// isolated, non-atomic transaction may affect multiple independent
/// `kvstore::Driver` objects.  In an isolated atomic transaction, there may
/// only be a single terminal node, and that node must commit atomically.
///
/// Note that `TransactionState` does not explicitly represent the links between
/// nodes; it merely contains a flat list of nodes.  It is up to the individual
/// `Node` implementations to keep track of any necessary dependency
/// relationships, e.g. via `kvstore::ReadModifyWriteSource` and
/// `kvstore::ReadModifyWriteTarget` objects.
///
/// As an example of a transactional operation, writing an in-memory array to a
/// non-sharded neuroglancer_precomputed volume with an explicit transaction
/// proceeds as follows:
///
/// 1. The user supplies a `Transaction` object that points to a non-null
///    `TransactionState`.
///
/// 2. The common `internal::DriverWrite` implementation calls
///    `AcquireOpenTransactionPtrOrError` to obtain an `OpenTransactionPtr` from
///    the `Transaction` that serves to block the transaction from being
///    committed while the write operation is in progress.  This fails if the
///    transaction has already been aborted by a prior error or call to
///    `Transaction::Abort`.  This allows the user to issue one or more
///    asynchronous operations on a transaction, then immediately call
///    `Transaction::Commit` to request the transaction be committed, and then
///    wait on the `Future` returned by `Transaction::Commit` to obtain the
///    combined status of all of the issued operations.
///
/// 3. The `neuroglancer_precomputed` `DataCache` class inherits its write
///    implementation from `ChunkCache`, which determines the relevant chunks,
///    and for each chunk, calls `GetTransactionNode` to obtain a transaction
///    node (a derived class of `TransactionState::Node`) in which to record the
///    writes to the chunk made within the given transaction.  These transaction
///    nodes are held via `OpenTransactionNodePtr` smart pointers to ensure the
///    transaction is not committed while they are in use, even if the initial
///    `OpenTransactionPtr` smart pointer is destroyed.
///
///    - If the chunk was already modified in the transaction by a prior write,
///      the existing transaction node will be re-used.  The existing
///      transaction node is located in the red-black tree of transaction nodes
///      (keyed by their associated `TransactionState` pointers) stored within
///      the `AsyncCache::Entry`.
///
///    - Otherwise, a new transaction node is created.  When the new transaction
///      node is initialized, the `neuroglancer_precomputed` `DataCache` class
///      inherits the behavior of `KvsBackedCache`, which calls
///      `kvstore::Driver::ReadModifyWrite` to create/update a transaction node
///      representing the modifications to the backing `kvstore::Driver`.
///
/// 4. After the copy stage of the write completes, all modifications are
///    recorded in transaction nodes, but no changes have been written back to
///    the backing `kvstore::Driver`.
///
/// 5. If the user calls `Transaction::Abort`, or an error occurs during
///    copying, the transaction is aborted, and the transaction nodes are
///    destroyed.
///
/// 6. Otherwise, if the user calls `Transaction::Commit`, or forces the future
///    returned from `Transaction::future()`, to request that the transaction is
///    committed.  Once all `OpenTransactionPtr` and `OpenTransactionNodePtr`
///    references are released, the commit proceeds by invoking the `Commit`
///    method of the nodes added to the transaction.
///
/// 7. The transaction node associated with the `kvstore::Driver` requests
///    writeback from all of the `ReadModifyWriteSource` objects that have been
///    added from `KvsBackedCache` via `ReadModifyWrite` operations, initially
///    with a `staleness_bound` of `absl::InfinitePast()`.  In turn, the
///    `KvsBackedCache` arranges for the `DataCache` to encode the modified
///    chunks (after reading and decoding the existing values from the
///    `kvstore::Driver`) and passes the updated values (along with the read
///    generations on which they are conditioned, if any) back to the
///    `kvstore::Driver` via the `ReadModifyWriteTarget` interface.  The
///    `kvstore::Driver` performs the writes (which may be conditioned on
///    existing generations).  If the generations don't match (due to concurrent
///    modifications), this step is repeated, with an updated `staleness_bound`
///    to ensure the updated values are read.
///
/// 8. Once all the `kvstore::Driver` writes complete (either successfully or
///    with an error), the transaction becomes ready.
///
/// In the case of a sharded neuroglancer_precomputed volume, everything
/// proceeds in the same way except:
///
/// - In step 3, when the `ChunkCache` creates a new transaction node, the
///   `Uint64ShardedKeyValueStore::ReadModifyWrite` implementation does not
///   create/update a transaction node directly on the backing
///   `kvstore::Driver`.  Instead, it obtains a new or existing transaction node
///   corresponding to the shard that contains the chunk.  (In general, many
///   chunks will be in the same shard.)  The
///   `Uint64ShardedKeyValueStoreWriteCache::TransactionNode`, in turn, also
///   inherits from `KvsBackedCache` which calls
///   `kvstore::Driver::ReadModifyWrite` to create/update a transaction node in
///   the backing `kvstore::Driver`.
///
/// - If all chunks are in the same shard, then the transaction will only affect
///   a single key in the backing `kvstore::Driver`, and the transaction can be
///   committed atomically even if the backing store does not support atomic
///   multi-key transactions.  Otherwise, each shard will be committed
///   separately, but there will still only be one write per shard.
///
/// In the case of a non-transactional write, fine-grained implicit transactions
/// are created automatically.  A non-transactional write to a non-sharded
/// neuroglancer_precomputed volume proceeds as follows:
///
/// 1. As in the transactional case, the `ChunkCache` determines the relevant
///    chunks, and for each chunk obtains an implicit transaction node, also by
///    calling `GetTransactionNode`.
///
///    - If the chunk has an existing implicit transaction node that is still
///      open (i.e. not already being committed), it is re-used.
///
///    - Otherwise, a new implicit transaction node is created, but not yet
///      associated with a transaction.  When the new transaction node is
///      initialized, `KvsBackedCache` calls `kvstore::Driver::ReadModifyWrite`.
///      The default `kvstore::Driver::ReadModifyWrite` implementation simply
///      creates a new unique implicit transaction.  Consequently, for each
///      modified chunk, there will be a separate implicit transaction
///      containing just two nodes, one node associated with the entry in the
///      `ChunkCache` and one node associated with the `kvstore::Driver`.
///
/// 2. If the user requests writeback of the complete write operation (by
///    forcing the `Future` returned from the write operation), commit is
///    requested for all of the implicit transactions.
///
/// 3. Alternatively, commit of implicit transactions may be triggered
///    automatically by memory pressure from the CachePool.
///
/// 4. In either case, each chunk will be written back independently; some may
///    remain in the cache while others are written back.
///
/// A non-transactional write to a sharded neuroglancer_precomputed volume
/// proceeds as follows:
///
/// 1. As in the non-sharded case above, the `ChunkCache` determine the relevant
///    chunks and obtains an implicit transaction node for each chunk.  When a
///    new implicit transaction node is created, `KvsBackedCache` calls
///    `Uint64ShardedKeyValueStore::ReadModifyWrite` to create a downstream
///    node.
///
///    - If there is already an open implicit transaction node associated with
///      the shard that contains the chunk, it is re-used, and the associated
///      implicit transaction is re-used by the upstream transaction node in the
///      `ChunkCache`.
///
///    - Otherwise, a new implicit transaction node is created for the shard,
///      and which in turn calls `kvstore::Driver::ReadModifyWrite` to obtain a
///      new transaction node in the backing `kvstore::Driver` and a new
///      implicit transaction.
///
///    Consequently, for each modified shard, there will be a separate implicit
///    transaction containing:
///
///    a. for each modified chunk in the shard, a `ChunkCache` transaction node;
///
///    b. a `Uint64ShardedKeyValueStoreWriteCache` transaction node
///       corresponding to the shard;
///
///    c. a transaction node corresponding to the writeback of the shard to the
///       backing `kvstore::Driver`.
///
/// 2. If the `CachePool` is sufficiently large that writeback is not triggered
///    automatically while the copying stage of the write operation is in
///    progress (and no manual writeback is requested), all writes to a given
///    shard will be optimally coalesced, just as in the case of an explicit
///    transaction.
///
/// 3. However, if writeback of a shard is triggered while the copying is still
///    in progress, there may be multiple writes to the same shard.

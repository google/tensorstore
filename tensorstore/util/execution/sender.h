/// Asynchronous channel interfaces.
///
/// A model of the `Sender<E, V...>` concept represents an asynchronous
/// producer/channel of a single tuple of values of types `V...`, which may
/// signal an error of type `E` in lieu of producing a value.  The counterpart
/// to a `Sender<E, V...>` is a `Receiver<E, V...>`, which represents a
/// continuation that either receives a tuple of values of types `V...` or an
/// error value of type `E`.  The usage is as follows:
///
///   1. A receiver is bound to a sender by invoking
///      `tensorstore::execution::submit(sender, receiver)`.  If `sender`
///      represents a deferred computation, the actual computation may not begin
///      until `submit` is called..
///
///   2. The sender sends a value by calling
///      `tensorstore::execution::set_value(receiver, v...)`, sends an error by
///      calling `tensorstore::execution::set_error(receiver, e)`, or indicates
///      that the computation was cancelled by calling
///      `tensorstore::execution::set_cancel(receiver)`.  At most one of these
///      functions may be called.
///
/// Unless explicitly permitted by a particular Sender, invoking `submit` more
/// than once results in undefined behavior.  Likewise, unless explicitly
/// permitted by a particular Receiver, invoking any of `set_value`, `set_error`
/// or `set_cancel` after any one of those functions has already been called
/// results in undefined behavior.
///
/// The `Sender` concept does not itself provide an in-band way for the receiver
/// to signal cancellation, but cancellation could be signaled through some
/// separate mechanism (e.g. a `Sender<E>` used by the consumer to signal
/// cancellation that is provided to the sender when it is created).
///
/// A model of the related `FlowSender<E, V...>` concept represents a producer
/// of a channel/stream of values that supports in-band cancellation (in
/// contrast, the `Sender`/`Receiver` concepts support transmission of just a
/// single result).  The consumer end of the channel is represented by a model
/// of the `FlowReceiver<E, V...>` concept:
///
///   1. A receiver is bound to a sender by invoking
///      `tensorstore::execution::submit(sender, receiver)`.
///
///   2. The sender calls
///      `tensorstore::execution::set_starting(receiver, cancel)`, where
///      `cancel` is a nullary function that may be called by the receiver to
///      request cancellation.  The provided `cancel` function is only valid to
///      call until the receiver's `set_stopping` callback has returned.
///
///   3. The sender calls `tensorstore::execution::set_value(receiver, v...)`
///      zero or more times to provide a stream of value tuples.
///
///   4. The sender indicates an error by calling
///      `tensorstore::execution::set_error(receiver, e)`, or indicates success
///      by calling `tensorstore::execution::set_done(receiver)`.  At most one
///      of `set_error` or `set_done` may be called, and `set_value` must not be
///      called after `set_error` or `set_done` is called.
///
///   5. The sender calls `tensorstore::execution::set_stopping(receiver)` to
///      indicate that the `cancel` function provided to `set_starting` is no
///      longer valid.
///
/// The `submit`, `set_starting`, `set_value`, `set_done`,`set_error`,
/// `set_cancel`, and `set_stopping` functions defined in the
/// `tensorstore::execution` namespace are function objects that serve as the
/// interface to customization points: for each customization point `X`,
/// `tensorstore::execution::X(obj, args...)` invokes `obj.X(args...)` if that
/// is defined, or otherwise invokes `X(obj, args...)` where `X` is found
/// through argument-dependent lookup (ADL).  To make a new or existing type
/// model one of the above mentioned concepts, simply define the appropriate
/// customization points as methods or free functions.
///
/// This file defines the above mentioned customization points as well as
/// type-erasure classes `AnySender`, `AnyReceiver`, `AnyFlowSender`, and
/// `AnyFlowReceiver`.
///
/// Refer to the definitions of `CancelSender`, `ErrorSender`, and `ValueSender`
/// below, `FlowSingleSender` and `RangeFlowSender` in sender_util.h, and
/// `LoggingReceiver` in `sender_testutil.h`, as examples.
///
///
/// The `tensorstore::Result<T>` type models both `Sender<absl::Status, T>` and
/// `Receiver<absl::Status, T>`.  The `tensorstore::Future<T>` type models
/// `Sender<absl::Status, T>`, while `tensorstore::Promise<T>` models
/// `Receiver<absl::Status, T>`.  The `MakeSenderFuture` function defined in
/// future.h converts any `Sender<absl::Status, T>` into a `Future<T>`:

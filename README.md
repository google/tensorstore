TensorStore is an open-source C++ and Python software library designed for
storage and manipulation of large multi-dimensional arrays that:

* Provides advanced, fully composable indexing operations and virtual views.

* Provides a uniform API for reading and writing multiple array formats, including
  [zarr](https://zarr.dev/) and [N5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5).

* Natively supports multiple storage systems, such as local and network
  filesystems, [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage),
  Amazon S3-compatible object stores, HTTP servers, and in-memory storage.

* Offers an asynchronous API to enable high-throughput access even to
  high-latency remote storage.

* Supports read caching and transactions, with strong atomicity,
  isolation, consistency, and durability (ACID) guarantees.

* Supports safe, efficient access from multiple processes and machines via
  optimistic concurrency.

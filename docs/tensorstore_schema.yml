title: Specifies a TensorStore to open/create.
description: |
  The following properties are supported by all TensorStore drivers.  Refer to
  the :ref:`driver documentation<tensorstore-drivers>` for the supported
  `.driver` identifiers and driver-specific properties.
properties:
  driver:
    type: string
    title: Driver identifier
    description: Specifies the :ref:`TensorStore driver<tensorstore-drivers>`.
  context:
    $ref: Context
    title: Specifies context resources that augment/override the parent context.
  dtype:
    $ref: dtype
    title: Specifies the data type.
  rank:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 32
    title: |
      Specifies the rank of the TensorStore.
    description: |
      If `.transform` is also specified, the input rank must match.  Otherwise,
      the rank constraint applies to the driver directly.
  transform:
    $ref: IndexTransform
    title: Specifies a transform.
  schema:
    $ref: Schema
    title: Specifies constraints on the schema.
    description: |
      When opening an existing array, specifies constraints on the existing
      schema; opening will fail if the constraints do not match.  Any soft
      constraints specified in the :json:schema:`~Schema.chunk_layout` are
      ignored.  When creating a new array, a suitable schema will be selected
      automatically based on the specified schema constraints in combination
      with any driver-specific constraints.

    title: Specifies a TensorStore data type.
    description: |
      TensorStore data types correspond to the logical data representation, not
      the precise encoding.  There are not separate data types for little endian
      and big endian byte order.

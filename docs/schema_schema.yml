      The data type is always a hard constraint.
  domain:
    $ref: IndexDomain
    title: |
      Domain of the TensorStore, including bounds and optional dimension labels.
    description: |
      The domain is always a hard constraint, except that a labeled dimension is
      allowed to match an unlabeled dimension, and an implicit, infinite bound
      is considered an unspecified bound and does not impose any constraints.
      When merging two schema constraint objects that both specify domains, any
      dimensions that are labeled in both domains must have the same label, and
      any explicit or finite bounds specified in both domains must be equal.  If
      a dimension is labeled in one domain and unlabeled in the other, the label
      is retained.  If a bound is implicit and infinite in one domain, the bound
      from the other domain is used.
  chunk_layout:
    $ref: ChunkLayout
    title: Data storage layout constraints.
    description: |
      The rank of the chunk layout must match the `.rank` of the schema.  When
      merging schema constraints objects, the chunk layout constraints are
      merged recursively.
  codec:
    $ref: Codec
    description: |
      Driver-specific compression and other parameters for encoding/decoding
      data.  When merging schema constraints objects, the codec constraints are
      merged recursively.

      - type: 'null'
    description: |
      Specifies the physical quantity corresponding to an increment of 1 index
      along each dimension, i.e. the *resolution*.  The length must match the
      `.rank` of the schema.  Specifying :json:`null` for a dimension indicates
      that the unit is unknown.

      .. admonition:: Example
         class: example

         :json:`["4nm", "4nm", null]` specifies that the voxel size is 4nm along
         the first two dimensions, and unknown along the third dimension.

      .. note::

         :json:`null` is not equivalent to specifying :json:`""` (or
         equivalently, :json:`[1, ""]`), which indicates a dimensionless unit of
         :json:`1`.
definitions:
  unit:
    $id: 'Unit'
    title: Specifies a physical quantity/unit.
    description: |
      The quantity is specified as the combination of:

      - A numerical :literal:`multiplier`, represented as a `double-precision
        floating-point number
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format>`_.
        A multiplier of ``1`` may be used to indicate a quanity equal to a
        single base unit.

      - A :literal:`base_unit`, represented as a string.  An empty string may be used
        to indicate a dimensionless quantity.  In general, TensorStore does not
        interpret the base unit string; some drivers impose additional
        constraints on the base unit, while other drivers may store the
        specified unit directly.  It is recommended to follow the `udunits2
        syntax
        <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2.0.4/udunits2lib.html#Syntax>`_
        unless there is a specific need to deviate.

      Three JSON formats are supported:

      - The canonical format, as a two-element :python:`[multiplier, base_unit]`
        array.  This format is always used by TensorStore when returning the
        JSON representation of a unit.

      - A single string.  If the string contains a leading number, it is parsed
        as the :literal:`multiplier` and the remaining portion, after stripping leading
        and trailing whitespace, is used as the :literal:`base_unit`.  If there is no
        leading number, the :literal:`multiplier` is 1 and the entire string, after
        stripping leading and trailing whitespace, is used as the :literal:`base_unit`.

      - A single number, to indicate a dimension-less unit with the specified
        multiplier.

         - :json:`"4.5e-9m"`, :json:`"4.5e-9 m"`, and :json:`[4.5e-9, "m"]` are
           all equivalent.

         - :json:`"1nm"`, :json:`"nm"`, and :json:`[1, "nm"]` are all
           equivalent.

         - :json:`5`, :json:`"5"`, and :json:`[5, ""]` are all equivalent.

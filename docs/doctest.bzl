"""Defines doctest_test rule for running Python doctests."""

# The _write_wrapper rule generates a shell script that invokes the doctest test
# driver on a specific doctest input file.
#
# The shell script locates the doctest test driver and doctest input file in its
# runfiles, using the bazel bash runfiles library, which is inlined into the
# generated shell script (inlining it avoids the chicken-and-egg problem of
# having to locate the bash runfiles library itself within the runfiles).
